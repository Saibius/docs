### Saibius Locust Connection Test

This video demonstrates a high-concurrency connection test using Locust, a Python-based load testing tool. In this test, multiple Locust clients concurrently download the Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop ISO (~5.9GB) via Saibius.  

The purpose is to observe how Saibius behaves under sustained high connection counts. System resource usage and runtime behavior can be monitored through Windows Task Manager, the server console, and the Locust dashboard shown in the video.
