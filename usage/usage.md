Share files instantly with nearby systems from your current OS.  
Saibius requires no installation and no configuration — just run it and start sharing.

A single command is enough:  
```bash
./saibius --file ./share
```

This command immediately exposes the specified file or directory over HTTP,
making it accessible to other systems on the same network or via a reachable address.  

No setup. No global install. No persistent services.  

### Use Case 2 : 

Saibius does not require global installation. 
Download it when needed, use it, and remove it afterward.

You can always fetch the latest binary from the website.
