### Saibius Update Note

v1.0.0.11(2026.02.12)    
TL;DR : Quick Update! Our next minor version (v1.0.0.11) will support the --share method for sharing, just like the --file method. Don’t worry, we’re keeping the original --file method too—this is just a little update to make things more convenient for you!  
- Patch to add support for share method to file method via alias  
- The code signing certificate has been changed. (Existing certificate > New: Artsnoa CA Apps)
- Support Android (Termux) Version  

Note: For the Android version, it may take some time as it is in the distribution stabilization phase.
